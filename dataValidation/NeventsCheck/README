The checkEventsMC and checkEventsData loop through all of the standard MxAOD files,
checking if the number of events that were ran over matches the number of events
on AMI.  This data is then displayed on the sample validation page on the website.

The scripts are ran like
source setup.sh # will ask for your grid proxy password if you don't have one setup
source checkEventsMC.sh h012pre2 Inputfiles/mc_h012pre2.txt
 
Where the first argument is the htag and the 2nd is a txt file like those in 
HGamTools/data/input/* that are of the format 
PowhegPy8_ggH125 mc15_13TeV:mc15_13TeV.341000.PowhegPythia8EvtGen_CT10_AZNLOCTEQ6L1_ggH125_gamgam.merge.DAOD_HIGG1D1.e3806_s2608_r6765_r6282_p2421/
as in
[SAMPLE NAME] [SAMPLE DAOD with scope and /]

This file should contain all of the files [use the data.txt with checkEventsData
and mc.txt with checkEventsMC.sh] that were made using the htag that is the
first arugment.

The output of these scripts is saved in ../data/HTAG/


These scripts take a LONG TIME to run since pyami is so slow.  It is possible to 
run these on lxplus batch, but you would need to create a grid proxy on your 
current node, copy the grid proxy that is created (e.g. /tmp/x509up_u38354 )
to the node that the script is running on (the /tmp/ directory also).
