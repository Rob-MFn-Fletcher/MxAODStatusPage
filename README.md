use update script to update everything on the site for a particular MxAOD release.  
e.g. source update.sh h011

check out the setup script (setup.sh) for things to change like:
  dataset directory on EOS
  variables that are plotted
  change in cutflow variables

##An Explanation of the files and folders in the main www/ folder:

###  AllCutflows
    As expected, it holds the scripts that make the cutflows for the new release,
    and the scripts used to compare variables between samples on the website

###  fileSize
    this holds the scripts to give the file size stats.  Currently not used on site.

###  html
    holds the navigation bar and PHP variables used by all of the PHP scripts. Very little html.

###  img
    most important folder of the site, holds the higgs man image.

    well as the scripts and php that create comparisons on-the-fly

    PHP that creates the individual sample pages.  Calls scripts to do cutflow, variable, and
    plot comparisons.

###  setup.sh
