use update script to update everything on the site.  
e.g. source update h011 h010

check out the setup script (setup.sh) for things to change like:
  MxAOD types (MxAOD, MxAODAllSys, etc.)
  folders for MxAOD types (mc_25ns, data_25ns, AllSys, etc.)
  dataset directory on EOS
  variables that are plotted
  change in cutflow variables
  
An Explanation of the folders:
  AllCutflows
    As expected, it holds the scripts that make the cutflows for the new release, 
    the release you are comparing to, and the difference between them
  cutflows
    this holds the cutflows for the front page of the website, though it should 
    probably be combined with the AllCutflows folder
  fileSize
    this holds the scripts to give the file size stats (on the front page)
  liveSearch
    holds the nuts and bolts of the awesome search function
  plotter
    has the scripts for making all of the kinematic variable plots for each dataset
  variables
    has the scripts for making the variable lists on the front page
